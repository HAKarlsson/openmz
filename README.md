# OpenMZ 

OpenMZ is an open-source implementation of [HexFive's MultiZone API](https://github.com/hex-five/multizone-api). 

OpenMZ is a separation kernel for RISC-V processors with m-mode and u-mode. OpenMZ partitions a system into an unlimited number of *zones*. Each zone has full access to eight regions of memory mapped I/O (e.g. RAM, UART, GPIO), protected using RISC-V's physical memory protection (PMP) mechanism.
